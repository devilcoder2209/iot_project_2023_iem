# iot_project_2023_iem

The design and prototype implementation of the new home automation system, that uses Wi-Fi technology as a network infrastructure connecting its parts. The proposed system consists of two main components first part is the server (webserver), which presents a system core that manages, controls, and monitors usersâ€™ homes. Users and the system administrator can locally (USB Serial) or remotely (Blynk IoT) manages and control system code. The second part is the hardware interface module, which provides an appropriate interface to the sensors and actuators of the home automation system. Unlike most of the available home-needed automation systems in the market, the anticipated system is scalable that one server can manage lots of hardware interface modules as long as it exists on (Wi-Fi) network coverages. Some System supports a wide range of home automation procedure like power management components, security components, etc. The proposed system is better from the scalability and elasticity point of view than the commercially available home computerization systems.
